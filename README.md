# SQL Code Challenges

SQL Code Challenges will be a space where I continue to develop my SQL programming skills. Exercises will be directly based on challenges from **DataLemur** and **HackerRank**.

Throughout the code solutions, I will try to log my journey by creating comments and documentation on my approach.

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized into respective directories for clarity:

* `datalemur/`: Contains solutions to Datalemur problems, typically named by problem number and title (e.g., `1_facebook_active_user_retention.sql`)
* `hackerrank/`: Contains solutions to Hackerrank problems, typically named by database topic (e.g., `weather_observation_station.sql` would include solutions for all queries using same source)

## Setup and Development Environment

Although I do pair SQL and Python together when developing my code in **Jupyter Notebook** via the **Anaconda** distribution on Windows, there are easier ways to centeralize code and databases.

To follow along with this repo, it may be best to set up your environment:

1. Download PostgreSQL (access via pgAdmin4)

   - Download the latest version for Windows https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
   - This video tutorial helps when you're getting started https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qH-7w5LZsA&ab_channel=UnitedTopTech

2. (alternatively) Go to https://www.db-fiddle.com/ and work with a web-based interface

## Challenge Log

This table provides an overview of the Datalemur challenges I've worked on:

| # | Title | Source | Solution Link | End Goal | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
 | 1 | facebook active user retention | [datalemur](https://datalemur.com/questions/user-retention) | [1_facebook_active_user_retention] | Write a query to obtain number of monthly active users (MAUs) in July 2022 |

This table provides an overview of the Hackerrank challenges I've worked on:

 | # | Title | Source | Solution Link | End Goal | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
 | 1 | weather observation station | [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-5/problem?isFullScreen=true) | [weather_observation_station_five] | Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths |
 | 2 | weather observation station | [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-20/problem?isFullScreen=true) | [weather_observation_station_twenty] | Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places |
